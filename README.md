# XFADS

**eXponential FAmily Dynamical Systems**

XFADS, built on JAX and Equinox.
For more information, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01371) and [original implementation](https://github.com/catniplab/xfads).

## Overview

XFADS provides a flexible framework for modeling and inference in dynamical systems where the state evolution follows exponential family distributions.
The library implements advanced variational inference techniques with support for:

- **Exponential Family Distributions**: Gaussian and other exponential family distributions
- **Variational Smoothing**: Forward-backward algorithms with pseudo and bi-filter modes
- **Neural Network Integration**: Deep learning components for dynamics and observation models
- **JAX Acceleration**: Fast computation with automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU support
- **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for custom dynamics and observation models
